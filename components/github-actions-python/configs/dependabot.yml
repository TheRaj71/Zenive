# Security-specific configuration
# Dependabot will automatically create PRs for security vulnerabilities
# regardless of the schedule, with higher priority

# Additional notes:
# 1. Security updates bypass the schedule and are created immediately
# 2. Dependabot will automatically rebase PRs when the base branch is updated
# 3. PRs are automatically closed if the dependency is updated by other means
# 4. Use 'dependabot.yml' validation tools to verify configuration syntax
# 5. Monitor Dependabot activity in the repository's Security tab
